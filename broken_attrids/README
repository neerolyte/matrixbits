Two part script to export/import attributes for an entire Matrix package after a broken upgrade.

Brokenness assumes that a Matrix package was missing during one of the upgrade steps resulting in attrids in sq_ast_attr not matching those in sq_ast_attr_val.

These scripts will serialise the data in the old system and RESET the attributes in the new system. It will not actually clean up the corruption on the new system.

They were written some time in 2009 for a very specifically broken upgrade from 3.something to 3.16.6, they may or may not be useful to you.
